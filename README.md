# Eco Ideathon Solution
AI-Powered Rooftop Solar PV Detection (EcoInnovators 2026)

This repository contains an end-to-end AI pipeline for detecting rooftop solar panels, calculating their area, and verifying compliance with the PM Surya Ghar scheme using satellite imagery.

📂 Repository Structure

pipeline/: Contains main.py, the core script for fetching images and running the model.

weights/: Contains the trained YOLOv8 model (best.pt).

environment/: Dependencies and version info.

model_card/: Detailed documentation of the model's performance and logic.

prediction_files/: JSON outputs generated by the pipeline.

artefacts/: Visual overlays (images with bounding boxes).

logs/: Training metrics.

🚀 Setup & Installation

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/ROHITHLASHETTI/Helio_Yajna_Solar_Detection.git](https://github.com/ROHITHLASHETTI/Helio_Yajna_Solar_Detection.git)
cd Helio_Yajna_Solar_Detection


2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r environment/requirements.txt


3. Configure API Key
Open pipeline/run_inference.py and add your Google Maps Static API Key:

GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"


🏃‍♂ How to Run

Prepare Input: Ensure you have an Excel file at input_data/input.xlsx with columns: sample_id, latitude, longitude.

Run Pipeline:

python pipeline/main.py


Check Results:

JSON data will appear in prediction_files/.

Images with detected boxes will appear in artefacts/.

🧠 Methodology

Model: YOLOv8-Large trained on ~10,000 satellite images.

Logic: Checks for solar panels within a 1200 sq.ft (primary) and 2400 sq.ft (secondary) buffer zone around the coordinate.

Quantification: Calculates area ($m^2$) based on pixel dimensions and GSD (0.15m/px).
